Which web event did you hook into to update the display name? 

	I look into the form and onsubmit events.

Where in your HTML did you link to your JavaScript file? Is there a better places? What's the best place? 

	I put them in the top of the HTML file. In my opinion is better to put every link to other files in the top, that way the HTML is clean.

Why is it best practice to store your CSS/JS in external files rather than in your HTML file? 

	Is better to kept each file clean to inspect any time.
